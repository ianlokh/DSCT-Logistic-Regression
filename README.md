# DSCT-Logistic-Regression

Data Description

This data set contains data on 21 variables and the classification whether an applicant is considered a Good or Bad credit risk for 1006 loan applicants.  

In this assignment, you will need to read in the CSV file in R and you will decide on the variables you would like to use in your regression model. 

The codebook “German-Credit-Codebook.pdf” will provide an explanation on variables and the description of the values.


Questions

To minimize loss from the bank’s perspective, the bank needs a decision rule regarding who to give approval of the loan and who not to. An applicant’s demographic and socio-economic profiles are considered by experienced credit analysts before a decision is taken regarding his/her loan application.

We would like to build a regression model which will be able to provide bank managers guidance for making a decision whether to approve a loan or not to a prospective applicant based on his/her profiles.

1)	Assess the data and ensure that there are no defects in it. 

2)	Determine if any categorical variables will need to be transformed, combined or split up. 

3)	Determine if there are any natural grouping of the credit applications using clustering techniques (k-means / MDS).

4)	Formulate and construct a suitable regression model.

5)	Step through your model and determine if there is any multicollinearity in the predictors and adjust your model accordingly.

6)	Explain the best regression model that you have constructed.

7)	Assess the predictive ability of the model and comment on your assessment.

8)	Construct a ROC curve and calculate the AUC to evaluate the regression model that you have built. Is the model you have constructed effective?
